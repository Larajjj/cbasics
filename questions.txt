Fig 1.1 explains typical c development environment
It takes place through 6 phases
Program is created in the editor
Preprocessor process the code
object code is created in the compiler
object code is linked with the system library by the linker and it stores it on disk by creating a file.
loader stores the program in memory 
CPU executes the program
what is an object code? 
      It is the output of the compiler after it processes the source code.
      Source code is the computer program which is typed into the computer by a human in programming language.
what is a compiler?
      It is a program which cnverts source code into object code.
Difference between text files and c files.
     A text files stores data in the form of alphabets, digits and other special symbols by storing their ASCII values and are in the human readable format. ( ASCII - American standard code for informaion interchange)
     C file is a source code file for a c or c++ program. It may include an entire program's source code or may be one of many source files reference within a programming project.
     
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
   int integer1; 
   int integer2; 
   int sum; 
   
   printf("Enter first integer\n"); 
   scanf("%d", &integer1 ); 
   printf("Enter second integer\n"); 
   scanf("%d", &integer2 ); 
   
   sum = integer1 + integer2; 
   printf("Sum is %d\n", sum ); 
   return 0 ;
}

Enter first integer
